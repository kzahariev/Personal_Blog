# Who am I? What am I? Why am I?

I am a technie with a passion for linux and all things technology - so I tend to spend a considerable amount of time online.
When I am not wired in, I typically enjoy calorie-intense activities which involve running, jumping, throwing stuff, and hitting people.
Inbetween I enjoy reading - primarily non-fiction the last couple of years, but I have a special place in my heart for Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, and Dostoyevsky

# Current Status

* Training and preparing for the 2023 American Football Balkan League.

# How did we get here?

* I have been active on several social media platforms, be it work or non-work related. This blog is meant to consolidate them all together. More to come on that note.
