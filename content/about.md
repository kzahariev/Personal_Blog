# Who am I? What am I? Why am I?

I am a technie with a passion for linux and all things technology - so I tend to spend a considerable amount of time online.
When I am not wired in, I typically enjoy calorie-intense activities which involve running, jumping, throwing stuff, and hitting people.

# Current Status

* Statistical analysis mini-project with a buddy of mine for the upcoming elections.
* This blog is still a work in progress.
* Working as a Product Owner for Amdocs, glueing teams together.
* Learning more about K8s, Prometheus, and Azure.
* Training and preparing for the 2023 Balkan Championship in Track & Field.
* Training and preparing for the 2023 American Football Balkan League.

# How did we get here?

* I have been active on several social media platforms, be it work or non-work related. This blog is meant to consolidate them all together. More to come on that note.
